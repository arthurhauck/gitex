# This is my first GIT repository

I add an extra line before doing "git commit -va" in order to "add" and "commit" with a single command.

This should be a non-conflicting modification made on a secondary branch.

Some changes made on the main branch.

Some changes before doing "git fetch".

One more change (part 3.1 q10).
